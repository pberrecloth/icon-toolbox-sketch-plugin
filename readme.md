##Icon Toolbox for Sketch##
#A set of tools for a perfect icon workflow in Sketch.#

A very early work in progress. Should allow when complete:

- Batch flattening of artwork to vector shapes
- Batch simplification and rounding of paths
- Batch placement on artboards and auto-slicing
- Batch export as optimized SVG files
- Auto-creation of Icon Font files using Grunt and Grunt-Web-Font
