#Icon Toolbox for Sketch - Work in progress!#

###A set of tools for a perfect icon workflow in Sketch###

In very early stages.

The end goal of this project is a plugin that will take the grunt work out of artworking new icons. It will make the process semi-automated, consistent and efficient. It will also automate the process of exporting optimized artwork into SVG, PNG and Icon Font formats.


**Done so far**

Flattens composite artwork down to its simplest form.

This plugin takes vector layers in white and black then automates a unifying, subtracting and flattening process.
